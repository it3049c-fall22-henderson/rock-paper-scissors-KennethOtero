## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 does your team deserve on this assignment. Revise the assignment grading guideline and assignment rubrics for guidance.

I'd give myself 17/20 points on this due to odd behavior I got whenever I ran 'npm test'. At the end of the terminal log, it stated that I passed all 31/31 tests, but the terminal was filled with "async" errors. To add onto this, when I initially ran 'npm install', it stated that there were some errors that could be fixed with 'npm audit fix', so that could be the cause of this behavior.

## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?

The main issue I was having was the form refreshing and some incorrect function calls. I copied the code from our lab
this week that prevented form default behavior and that allowed me to actually test the game. Once I fixed my function calls (I was assigning score/history methods to variables instead of just calling them) everything ran as expected. Apart from that, I'm glad I was able to be exposed to Bootstrap this week.

### How long it took us to finish this?
I worked on this on and off throughout the night, so maybe around 3 hours in total.
